Q.1]
Write a program to multiply two matrices of size (100,100) in two methods:
(a) By using np.dot(mat_1,mat_2)
(b) By using for loops
Compare the time of execution in both the cases

Q.2] 
Write a program to execute the steps below using NumPy:
 
                      Zᵢⱼ = ∑WᵢₖXₖⱼ
         
                      σᵢⱼ(Zᵢⱼ) = 1/[1+e^(-Zᵢⱼ)]

where W and X are matrices of random numbers having dimensions (m,n) and (n,k) respectively. 
σ(Z) is a function which performs above defined operation on elements of Z

Q.3] 
Create two vectors y and ŷ having same dimensions, where ŷ should consist of random numbers between [0,1] and y should contains 0s and 1s.
For example: y = [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,...,1]
Compute the given expression:

                  O = -(1/n)*∑[yᵢlog₂(ŷᵢ)+(1-yᵢ)log₂(1-ŷᵢ)]

where n is total number of elements in y and ŷ.
